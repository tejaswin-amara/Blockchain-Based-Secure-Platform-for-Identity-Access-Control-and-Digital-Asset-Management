**Blockchain Secure Platform** is an MVP reference architecture for decentralized identity, smart-contract-enforced role-based access control, and NFT-backed digital-asset ownership. It is designed for security-conscious organizations that need verifiable identity-to-asset relationships, controlled administrative workflows, and an immutable event trail without placing sensitive personal data directly on-chain.

The project is tailored to the **Blockchain & Cybersecurity** domain and is intended as a technical foundation for evaluation by **Bharat Electronics Limited**. It is not a production security certification, a legal opinion, or an endorsement by Bharat Electronics Limited. Production use requires a formal threat model, privacy review, key-management design, smart-contract audit, operational controls, and an approved deployment policy.

> **Core principle:** Put proofs, identifiers, hashes, roles, and state transitions on-chain; keep sensitive personal data and large files off-chain, encrypted, access-controlled, and governed by an explicit retention policy.

## What the platform provides

The platform connects four trust functions into one auditable workflow. A decentralized identifier (DID) represents an identity independently of a single application database. Smart contracts enforce administrator-controlled role assignment and permission checks. Digital assets are represented by unique non-fungible tokens (NFTs) whose ownership history can be independently verified. Contract events provide a tamper-evident history for identity, asset, allocation, transfer, and permission operations. DID terminology follows the W3C Decentralized Identifiers model, while NFT behavior is documented against the ERC-721 interface conventions.[1] [2]

The MVP deliberately separates **on-chain truth** from **off-chain application services**. A contract should not store raw identity documents, credentials, biometric data, secrets, or regulated personal information. Instead, permitted asset payloads are encrypted with an AES-256 data-encryption key before IPFS or approved object storage; the key is protected separately through controlled wrapping/access logic, with enterprise KMS/HSM integration reserved for production. The chain records only the minimum cryptographic references needed to verify integrity and authorization.

### Trust boundaries

The **wallet or identity adapter** signs user intent; it does not make an identity trustworthy by itself. The **FastAPI service** validates input and assembles application views but cannot rewrite blockchain history. The **smart-contract layer** is the authorization boundary for state-changing asset and role operations. The **database, job queue, and object store** are replaceable off-chain components and must be treated as recoverable projections, not as the source of ownership truth.

## Quickstart

### Prerequisites

Install the following before starting:

| Requirement | Recommended version | Purpose |
|---|---:|---|
| Git | 2.40+ | Source control |
| Node.js | 22 LTS | Hardhat contracts and Next.js frontend |
| pnpm | 11.21.0 | JavaScript workspace management |
| Python | 3.11+ | FastAPI service and tooling |
| Docker | 24+ | PostgreSQL, Redis, and MinIO local dependencies |
| Foundry or a compatible wallet | Current stable | Optional contract interaction and testnet workflows |

### Clone and configure

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tejaswin-amara/Blockchain-Based-Secure-Platform-for-Identity-Access-Control-and-Digital-Asset-Management.git
cd Blockchain-Based-Secure-Platform-for-Identity-Access-Control-and-Digital-Asset-Management
cp .env.example .env
```

Review `.env` before running anything. Use local-only test accounts and throwaway keys for development. Never commit `.env`, private keys, seed phrases, production RPC credentials, or real identity data.

### Start local dependencies

```bash
docker compose up -d postgres redis minio
```

If a Compose file has not yet been added to the implementation repository, start equivalent local services and configure their connection strings using `.env`. The documentation suite intentionally does not assume that containers are available in the first prototype commit.

### Install workspace dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r services/api/requirements.txt
```

### Run contract tests

```bash
pnpm test
pnpm build
```

Contract tests should cover unauthorized minting, unauthorized role changes, duplicate allocation, ownership transfer, event emission, paused or emergency states, and any upgradeability policy. Do not deploy an unreviewed contract to a public network.

### Run the API and frontend

```bash
pnpm --filter web dev
. .venv/bin/activate && uvicorn services.api.app:app --reload --port 8000
```

The expected local endpoints are `http://localhost:3000` for the web console and `http://localhost:8000` for the API. Exact commands may change as implementation packages are introduced; keep this README and the ADR synchronized with those changes.

### Run quality checks

```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm test
pnpm build
python -m pytest services/api/tests
```

For browser-level validation, run the Cypress suite after the web and API services are available. Accessibility checks should be part of the same review path, using automated checks as a baseline rather than a substitute for manual keyboard and screen-reader testing.[3]

## Representative domain flows

### Identity registration

An authorized operator creates or registers an identity record, associates a DID or DID reference with the application subject, and emits an event containing only the minimum public verification material. Revocation and key rotation must be explicit operations. A DID reference is not a guarantee that the subject is a real-world person or organization; that assurance comes from the platform's approved verification process.

### Role and permission assignment

An administrator assigns a predefined role such as `ADMIN`, `MANAGER`, `AUDITOR`, or `USER`. Contracts enforce who may grant or revoke roles, and the API mirrors the resulting state for user interfaces. The implementation must define whether roles are global, tenant-scoped, asset-scoped, or time-bound before production deployment.

### Asset minting and allocation

An authorized manager mints a unique ERC-721 asset with a unique organizational asset ID and a fixed-size metadata hash, associates the token with an active identity, and emits a structured allocation event. Duplicate asset IDs are rejected. Owners can request access, but sensitive enterprise transfers require the manager-controlled transfer path; standard ERC-721 approvals are disabled in the MVP.

### Controlled access request

An active identity submits `requestAccess(tokenId, action)`. The contract evaluates the owner, manager, and auditor policy and emits `AccessDecision` with a `GRANTED` or `DENIED` result without reverting on denial. This preserves a committed decision event while keeping asset ownership separate from read or use permission.

### Verification and audit

A verifier reads contract state and events, confirms the token and organizational asset ID, checks ownership history, and compares the metadata hash with the approved encrypted off-chain object. If IPFS is used, the encrypted payload is referenced by its CID; a CID is not simply a SHA-256 file hash. Owners, managers, and auditors receive separate access decisions, and blockchain authorization cannot prevent copying after an authorized decryption.

## Default technology stack versus alternatives

| Capability | MVP default | Viable alternative | Decision criterion |
|---|---|---|---|
| Contract language | Solidity | Vyper | Use Solidity for ecosystem maturity and OpenZeppelin compatibility; reassess for specialized assurance needs |
| Contract framework | Hardhat | Foundry | Use Hardhat for TypeScript integration; use Foundry when Solidity-native testing and fuzzing become primary |
| Contract libraries | OpenZeppelin Contracts | Solmate or audited internal modules | Prefer well-maintained, reviewed primitives; never replace them only to reduce dependency count |
| Identity model | DID reference plus application verification | Enterprise PKI, Verifiable Credentials, or a permissioned identity network | Choose based on assurance, revocation, interoperability, and organizational policy |
| Blockchain | Local Hardhat network, then approved EVM testnet | Hyperledger Besu, Polygon PoS, private EVM network | Select for governance, finality, privacy, cost, operational ownership, and regulatory constraints |
| API | FastAPI + Pydantic + Web3.py | NestJS, Go, or a managed indexer | Choose based on team skills, latency, event-processing needs, and operational support |
| Database | PostgreSQL | MySQL/TiDB or a managed relational service | Use a relational projection for queryability; chain remains the ownership source of truth |
| Frontend | Next.js + React + TypeScript | Vite + React or another approved frontend | Choose based on deployment model, wallet support, accessibility, and team conventions |
| UI foundation | shadcn/ui and accessible primitives | Material UI or an internal design system | Select the system with the strongest accessibility and governance fit |
| Jobs | Redis + BullMQ | Celery, Temporal, or cloud queues | Use a durable workflow system when indexing, retries, and reconciliation become business-critical |
| Object storage | S3-compatible storage such as MinIO locally | Managed S3, Azure Blob, or encrypted enterprise storage | Select according to data residency, retention, encryption, and availability requirements |
| Browser testing | Cypress | Playwright | Use whichever is standardized by the organization; keep critical flows deterministic |
| Delivery | GitHub Actions + Docker Compose | GitLab CI, Azure DevOps, or Kubernetes | Select based on the organization's approved software supply-chain controls |

## Security and privacy boundaries

Treat private keys as high-impact credentials. Use a hardware-backed or managed key-management solution for privileged production actions, enforce multi-party approval where appropriate, and document key rotation and recovery. The contract administrator should not be a single unreviewed externally owned account in a production deployment.

The platform must not expose personal data through public events, token metadata, logs, error messages, or analytics. Hashing data does not automatically remove privacy risk when the underlying data can be recovered or linked. Define retention, erasure, revocation, subject-access, and legal-review procedures before storing identity-related data.

The repository's `SECURITY.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, ADRs, [`docs/COMPLIANCE-REPORT.md`](docs/COMPLIANCE-REPORT.md), [`docs/THREAT-MODEL.md`](docs/THREAT-MODEL.md), [`docs/ENCRYPTION-KEY-MANAGEMENT.md`](docs/ENCRYPTION-KEY-MANAGEMENT.md), and [`docs/SECURITY-SCANNING-STATUS.md`](docs/SECURITY-SCANNING-STATUS.md) describe the intended controls and current evidence boundaries. They do not replace an organization-specific security assessment.

## Maintenance and assurance status

This prototype is maintained through reviewed pull requests, scheduled dependency and security workflows, release automation, and the recurring checks documented in [`MAINTENANCE.md`](MAINTENANCE.md). The official [OpenSSF Best Practices assessment](https://www.bestpractices.dev/en/projects/new) is not yet registered for this project; the neutral badge above intentionally indicates **assessment pending** rather than claiming a completed badge level.

## Project status

The project is at the **prototype/MVP stage** with an executable Solidity contract baseline, focused tests, and architecture/governance documentation. The API, indexer, web/mobile clients, IPFS cluster, production key custody, and independent audit are not yet implemented or evidenced. Roadmap progress, supported networks, contract addresses, and release artifacts should be updated as implementation work is accepted.

## Contributing and support

Read [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) before opening a pull request. Security vulnerabilities must follow [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md), not a public issue. General questions belong in [`SUPPORT.md`](SUPPORT.md). Architectural changes should follow the RFC and ADR workflow in [`GOVERNANCE.md`](GOVERNANCE.md). Proposal alignment and production-gate status are tracked in [`docs/COMPLIANCE-REPORT.md`](docs/COMPLIANCE-REPORT.md). Requirement-level evidence is mapped in [`docs/PROBLEM-STATEMENT-TRACEABILITY.md`](docs/PROBLEM-STATEMENT-TRACEABILITY.md).

## Curated reference projects

The repository preserves the 15 supplied SSI, DID, IAM, NFT, encrypted-storage, and permissioned-ledger projects as curated references. Review [`docs/REFERENCED-REPOSITORIES.md`](docs/REFERENCED-REPOSITORIES.md) for the complete catalog, [`docs/REFERENCE-INTEGRATION.md`](docs/REFERENCE-INTEGRATION.md) for adoption decisions, and [`THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`](THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md) for attribution and license boundaries. Only OpenZeppelin Contracts is currently adopted as a runtime dependency; the other projects are not vendored, added as submodules, or represented as product components.
