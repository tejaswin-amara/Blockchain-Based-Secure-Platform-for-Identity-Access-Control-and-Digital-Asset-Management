**Blockchain Secure Platform** is a submission-ready final-project engineering foundation for decentralized identity references, smart-contract-enforced role-based access control, and NFT-backed digital-asset ownership. It is designed for security-conscious organizations that need verifiable identity-to-asset relationships, controlled administrative workflows, and an immutable event trail without placing sensitive personal data directly on-chain.

The project is tailored to the **Blockchain & Cybersecurity** domain and is intended as a technical foundation for evaluation by **Bharat Electronics Limited**. It is not a production security certification, a legal opinion, or an endorsement by Bharat Electronics Limited. Production use requires a formal threat model, privacy review, key-management design, smart-contract audit, operational controls, and an approved deployment policy.

> **Core principle:** Put proofs, identifiers, hashes, roles, and state transitions on-chain; keep sensitive personal data and large files off-chain, encrypted, access-controlled, and governed by an explicit retention policy.

## What the platform provides

The platform connects four trust functions into one auditable workflow. A decentralized identifier (DID) represents an identity independently of a single application database. Smart contracts enforce administrator-controlled role assignment and permission checks. Digital assets are represented by unique non-fungible tokens (NFTs) whose ownership history can be independently verified. Contract events provide a tamper-evident history for identity, asset, allocation, transfer, and permission operations. DID terminology follows the W3C Decentralized Identifiers model, while NFT behavior is documented against the ERC-721 interface conventions.[1] [2]

The final-project boundary deliberately separates **on-chain truth** from **off-chain application services**. A contract must not store raw identity documents, credentials, biometric data, secrets, or regulated personal information. The repository contains a local AES-256-GCM envelope and declared-metadata policy reference only; it accepts no real payloads, operates no IPFS/object-storage adapter, and has no KMS/HSM custody. The chain records only the minimum opaque cryptographic references defined by the canonical contract.

```

### Trust boundaries

The **future identity adapter** cannot make an identity trustworthy by itself and remains fail closed until an approved provider/DID profile exists. The **FastAPI service** validates configuration and bounded input, records intents only, and cannot rewrite blockchain history or submit a transaction. The **smart-contract layer** is the canonical authorization boundary for state-changing asset and role operations. The **database, future job queue, and future object store** are recoverable off-chain components, not the source of ownership truth.

## Quickstart

### Prerequisites

Install the following before starting:

| Requirement | Recommended version | Purpose |
|---|---:|---|
| Git | 2.40+ | Source control |
| Node.js | 22 LTS | Hardhat contracts and the future Vite/React frontend |
| pnpm | 11.21.0 | JavaScript workspace management |
| Python | 3.11+ | FastAPI service and tooling |
| Docker | 24+ | Optional disposable PostgreSQL and future service dependencies |
| Foundry or a compatible wallet | Current stable | Optional contract interaction and testnet workflows |

### Clone and configure

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tejaswin-amara/Blockchain-Based-Secure-Platform-for-Identity-Access-Control-and-Digital-Asset-Management.git
cd Blockchain-Based-Secure-Platform-for-Identity-Access-Control-and-Digital-Asset-Management
cp .env.example .env
```

Review `.env` before running anything. Use local-only test accounts and throwaway keys for development. Never commit `.env`, private keys, seed phrases, production RPC credentials, or real identity data.

### Install and validate the current MVP

The current implementation includes the Solidity/Hardhat contract baseline, a fail-closed FastAPI service boundary with durable transaction-intent/audit adapters when validated configuration is supplied, confirmed RPC/indexer projection primitives, AES-GCM envelope references, SQLAlchemy/Alembic PostgreSQL schema, a repository-native Vite/React Evidence Ledger console, and a direct-RPC verifier CLI. It does not include signing/submission authority, managed key custody or a production storage adapter, approved live identity/authentication, an approved network deployment, or production operations. Do not start undocumented services or install dependencies from missing paths.

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
python3 -m pip install --require-hashes --requirement services/api/requirements.lock
python3 -m pip install --require-hashes --requirement services/storage/requirements.lock
pnpm validate:environment -- --file .env.example --environment local
pnpm validate:references
pnpm validate:markdown
pnpm lint
pnpm test
pnpm run test:coverage
pnpm build
pnpm test:services
pnpm check:web
pnpm test:web
pnpm test:web:e2e
pnpm build:web
pnpm check:web:bundle
pnpm test:verifier
pnpm test:verifier:e2e
```

A disposable local deployment can be generated with `pnpm deploy:local`. The script permits only the local/CI chain policy, verifies chain ID and deployed bytecode, and writes a manifest. Validate the generated evidence with `pnpm validate:deployment-manifest -- --file deployments/local.json`. Non-local environments remain blocked until an approved network and custody policy is recorded.

The contract test suite covers identity lifecycle, RBAC, asset allocation, controlled transfer paths, access decisions, pause behavior, and rejection paths. The API boundary tests cover fail-closed authentication, readiness, request correlation, and production configuration rejection. Contract tests must continue to cover unauthorized minting, unauthorized role changes, duplicate allocation, ownership transfer, event emission, paused or emergency states, and any upgradeability policy. Do not deploy an unreviewed contract to a public network.

### Gated API, indexer, storage, and frontend work

The API records typed intents only and returns a sanitized audit projection only after an approved authentication boundary is configured; it never signs, submits, or confirms chain transactions. `services/indexer` contains strict decoding, confirmed scan, reorganization, and reconciliation references but not a persistent scheduler/worker. `services/storage` contains an AES-GCM envelope, declared classification, and non-secret key-release policy but no object store or KMS. [ADR 0009](docs/ADR/0009-react-vite-web-console-boundary.md) selects the implemented repository-native Vite/React Evidence Ledger console, which has no signer, browser secret persistence, or authority to change canonical state. The verifier is tested against a disposable Hardhat JSON-RPC deployment only; real identity integration, workers, storage adapters, live authenticated API configuration, approved network deployment, and production endpoints require their corresponding decision gates.

### Run quality checks

The current repository quality gate is:

```bash
pnpm validate:environment -- --file .env.example --environment local
pnpm validate:references
pnpm validate:markdown
pnpm lint
pnpm test
pnpm run test:coverage
pnpm build
pnpm test:services
pnpm check:web
pnpm test:web
pnpm test:web:e2e
pnpm build:web
pnpm check:web:bundle
pnpm test:verifier
pnpm test:verifier:e2e
```

The web type/unit/E2E/axe/build/bundle checks and direct-RPC verifier checks are mandatory CI gates. Accessibility validation still requires named manual keyboard, zoom, screen-reader, and cross-browser review before pilot or production use.[3]

## Representative domain flows

### Identity registration

An authorized operator creates or registers an identity record, associates a DID or DID reference with the application subject, and emits an event containing only the minimum public verification material. Revocation and key rotation must be explicit operations. A DID reference is not a guarantee that the subject is a real-world person or organization; that assurance comes from the platform's approved verification process.

### Role and permission assignment

An administrator assigns a predefined role such as `ADMIN`, `MANAGER`, `AUDITOR`, or `USER`. Contracts enforce who may grant or revoke roles, and the API mirrors the resulting state for user interfaces. The implementation must define whether roles are global, tenant-scoped, asset-scoped, or time-bound before production deployment.

### Asset minting and allocation

An authorized manager mints a unique ERC-721 asset with a unique organizational asset ID and a fixed-size metadata hash, associates the token with an active identity, and emits a structured allocation event. Duplicate asset IDs are rejected. Owners can request access, but sensitive enterprise transfers require the manager-controlled transfer path; standard ERC-721 approvals are disabled in the MVP.

### Controlled access request

An active identity submits `requestAccess(tokenId, action)`. The contract evaluates the owner, manager, and auditor policy and emits `AccessDecision` with a `GRANTED` or `DENIED` result without reverting on denial. This preserves a committed decision event while keeping asset ownership separate from read or use permission.

### Verification and audit

A verifier reads contract state and events, confirms the token and organizational asset ID, checks ownership history, and compares the metadata hash with the approved encrypted off-chain object. If IPFS is used, the encrypted payload is referenced by its CID; a CID is not simply a SHA-256 file hash. Owners, managers, and auditors receive separate access decisions, and blockchain authorization cannot prevent copying after an authorized decryption.

## Default technology stack versus alternatives

| Capability | Final-project selected direction | Viable alternative | Decision criterion |
|---|---|---|---|
| Contract language | Solidity | Vyper | Use Solidity for ecosystem maturity and OpenZeppelin compatibility; reassess for specialized assurance needs |
| Contract framework | Hardhat | Foundry | Use Hardhat for TypeScript integration; use Foundry when Solidity-native testing and fuzzing become primary |
| Contract libraries | OpenZeppelin Contracts | Solmate or audited internal modules | Prefer well-maintained, reviewed primitives; never replace them only to reduce dependency count |
| Identity model | DID reference plus application verification | Enterprise PKI, Verifiable Credentials, or a permissioned identity network | Choose based on assurance, revocation, interoperability, and organizational policy |
| Blockchain | Local Hardhat network, then approved EVM testnet | Hyperledger Besu, Polygon PoS, private EVM network | Select for governance, finality, privacy, cost, operational ownership, and regulatory constraints |
| API | FastAPI + Pydantic + Web3.py | NestJS, Go, or a managed indexer | Choose based on team skills, latency, event-processing needs, and operational support |
| Database | PostgreSQL | MySQL/TiDB or a managed relational service | Use a relational projection for queryability; chain remains the ownership source of truth |
| Frontend | Vite + React + TypeScript (ADR 0009) | Next.js or another approved frontend | Keep browser/server authority separate; reassess only with an SSR or platform requirement and a new ADR |
| UI foundation | shadcn/ui and accessible primitives | Material UI or an internal design system | Select the system with the strongest accessibility and governance fit |
| Jobs | Redis + BullMQ | Celery, Temporal, or cloud queues | Use a durable workflow system when indexing, retries, and reconciliation become business-critical |
| Object storage | S3-compatible storage such as MinIO locally | Managed S3, Azure Blob, or encrypted enterprise storage | Select according to data residency, retention, encryption, and availability requirements |
| Browser testing | Cypress | Playwright | Use whichever is standardized by the organization; keep critical flows deterministic |
| Delivery | GitHub Actions + Docker Compose | GitLab CI, Azure DevOps, or Kubernetes | Select based on the organization's approved software supply-chain controls |

## Security and privacy boundaries

Treat private keys as high-impact credentials. Use a hardware-backed or managed key-management solution for privileged production actions, enforce multi-party approval where appropriate, and document key rotation and recovery. The contract administrator should not be a single unreviewed externally owned account in a production deployment.

The platform must not expose personal data through public events, token metadata, logs, error messages, or analytics. Hashing data does not automatically remove privacy risk when the underlying data can be recovered or linked. Define retention, erasure, revocation, subject-access, and legal-review procedures before storing identity-related data.

The repository's `SECURITY.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, ADRs, [`docs/COMPLIANCE-REPORT.md`](docs/COMPLIANCE-REPORT.md), [`docs/THREAT-MODEL.md`](docs/THREAT-MODEL.md), [`docs/FINAL-PROJECT-DATA-DICTIONARY.md`](docs/FINAL-PROJECT-DATA-DICTIONARY.md), [`docs/ENCRYPTION-KEY-MANAGEMENT.md`](docs/ENCRYPTION-KEY-MANAGEMENT.md), [`docs/SECURITY-SCANNING-STATUS.md`](docs/SECURITY-SCANNING-STATUS.md), and [`docs/COMPREHENSIVE-IMPROVEMENT-AND-FIX-REGISTER.md`](docs/COMPREHENSIVE-IMPROVEMENT-AND-FIX-REGISTER.md) describe the intended controls, current evidence boundaries, and complete remediation backlog. They do not replace an organization-specific security assessment. The active implementation backlog is tracked in [Issue #12](https://github.com/tejaswin-amara/Blockchain-Based-Secure-Platform-for-Identity-Access-Control-and-Digital-Asset-Management/issues/12).

## Maintenance and assurance status

This prototype is maintained through reviewed pull requests, scheduled dependency and security workflows, release automation, and the recurring checks documented in [`MAINTENANCE.md`](MAINTENANCE.md). The official [OpenSSF Best Practices assessment](https://www.bestpractices.dev/en/projects/new) is not yet registered for this project; the neutral badge above intentionally indicates **assessment pending** rather than claiming a completed badge level.

## Project status

The project is in an **active final-project execution phase**: the Solidity/Hardhat contract baseline, fail-closed API, PostgreSQL-oriented persistence, indexer, storage reference boundaries, governance baseline, decision register, data dictionary, diagrams, role/failure acceptance scenarios, a repository-native read-only Evidence Ledger console, a bounded Compose topology, and a guarded synthetic PostgreSQL restore drill are implemented. The console is not an approved live identity, signer, deployment, storage, or independent-verification product component. An approved identity provider, network/custody decision, persistent worker deployment, KMS/HSM custody, production storage adapter, live authenticated API configuration, independent verifier release evidence, and independent assurance remain gated work. This label does not claim production readiness, controlled-testnet approval, independent audit, legal approval, or BEL endorsement. The maintained roadmap is [`docs/FINAL-PROJECT-COMPLETION-PLAN.md`](docs/FINAL-PROJECT-COMPLETION-PLAN.md), with the current execution, source-adoption, governance, decision, data, migration, and no-push procedures in [`docs/FINAL-PROJECT-EXECUTION-PLAN-V2.md`](docs/FINAL-PROJECT-EXECUTION-PLAN-V2.md), [`docs/PROJECT-ENGINEERING-DEFAULTS.md`](docs/PROJECT-ENGINEERING-DEFAULTS.md), [`docs/FINAL-PROJECT-GOVERNANCE-BASELINE.md`](docs/FINAL-PROJECT-GOVERNANCE-BASELINE.md), [`docs/FINAL-PROJECT-DECISION-REGISTER.md`](docs/FINAL-PROJECT-DECISION-REGISTER.md), [`docs/FINAL-PROJECT-DATA-DICTIONARY.md`](docs/FINAL-PROJECT-DATA-DICTIONARY.md), [`docs/FINAL-PROJECT-MIGRATION-NOTES-TEMPLATE.md`](docs/FINAL-PROJECT-MIGRATION-NOTES-TEMPLATE.md), [`docs/FINAL-RELEASE-GATE.md`](docs/FINAL-RELEASE-GATE.md), [`docs/ADR/0009-react-vite-web-console-boundary.md`](docs/ADR/0009-react-vite-web-console-boundary.md), [`docs/runbooks/LOCAL-COMPOSE.md`](docs/runbooks/LOCAL-COMPOSE.md), and [`docs/runbooks/POSTGRES-BACKUP-RESTORE-DRILL.md`](docs/runbooks/POSTGRES-BACKUP-RESTORE-DRILL.md).

## Curated reference projects

The repository preserves the 15 supplied SSI, DID, IAM, NFT, encrypted-storage, and permissioned-ledger projects as curated references. Review [`docs/REFERENCED-REPOSITORIES.md`](docs/REFERENCED-REPOSITORIES.md) for the original catalog, [`docs/REFERENCE-INTEGRATION.md`](docs/REFERENCE-INTEGRATION.md) for original adoption decisions, [`docs/reference-ledger.md`](docs/reference-ledger.md) for the complete 96-source utilization ledger, and [`THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`](THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md) for attribution and license boundaries. Only OpenZeppelin Contracts is currently adopted as a runtime dependency; the other projects and the expanded full-stack/tooling sources are not silently vendored, added as submodules, or represented as product components without a focused gate.
