# Code-Scanning Remediation Status

## Scope

This document records the remediation applied to the repository's OpenSSF Scorecard and dependency-scanning findings. It separates fixes that can be committed in source control from controls that require GitHub repository settings, historical pull-request activity, or upstream package releases.

## Applied repository fixes

| Finding | Remediation | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Unpinned GitHub Actions | Pinned checkout, pnpm, Node, CodeQL, Scorecard upload, artifact, and Echidna actions to immutable commit SHAs | `.github/workflows/*.yml` |
| Excess release token permissions | Moved write permissions from workflow scope to the release job; workflow scope is read-only | `.github/workflows/release.yml` |
| Runtime release package resolution | Locked semantic-release and plugin versions in `package.json`/`pnpm-lock.yaml`; release uses `pnpm exec semantic-release` | `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `release.yml` |
| Missing SAST workflow | Added CodeQL analysis for JavaScript/TypeScript on pushes, pull requests, schedule, and manual dispatch | `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` |
| Missing fuzzing integration | Added a pinned Echidna workflow and invariant harness for administrator and approval controls, plus a fast-check TypeScript property suite recognized by Scorecard | `.github/workflows/fuzz.yml`, `contracts/test/SecureAssetPlatformEchidna.sol`, `contracts/test/IdentityReference.property.test.ts` |
| Vulnerable transitive dependencies | Migrated from Hardhat 2 to Hardhat 3, removed the vulnerable ethers v5 dependency path, retained explicit narrow plugins, and kept a moderate-or-higher CI audit gate | `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `hardhat.config.ts`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml` |
| Missing reference/security validation | Existing reference validator and CI checks remain active alongside the new security gates | `scripts/validate_references.py`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml` |

## Current alert remediation status

The current dashboard alerts are tracked explicitly rather than dismissed without evidence:

| Alert | Signal | Severity shown | Current status and evidence |
|---:|---|---|---|
| #19 | Maintained | High | Repository-side maintenance evidence has been strengthened with `MAINTENANCE.md`, scheduled workflows, Dependabot, release automation, contribution guidance, and security policy. The remaining age component is detector-controlled and resolves only after the repository has sufficient history. |
| #17 | Code-Review | High | `main` is protected and requires reviewed pull requests, one approving review, conversation resolution, linear history, and successful security checks. Historical direct commits cannot be retroactively converted into approved changesets; an eligible collaborator must approve future remediation PRs for the historical ratio to improve. |
| #20 | SAST | Medium | CodeQL runs successfully on current pushes and pull requests. The remaining Scorecard ratio reflects that the workflow was introduced after earlier commits; historical commits cannot be retroactively scanned by a workflow that did not exist at those revisions. |
| #16 | CII-Best-Practices | Low | The repository now links the official OpenSSF Best Practices assessment and clearly marks it as pending. Registration and assessment require the repository owner to authenticate at [bestpractices.dev](https://www.bestpractices.dev/en/projects/new) and complete the external questionnaire. |

## Remaining external or upstream limits

The dependency audit is now clean: `pnpm audit --audit-level=moderate` reports no known vulnerabilities, and the Hardhat 3 lockfile contains no `elliptic` package. The previous low advisory was removed by eliminating the Hardhat 2 ethers v5 dependency path rather than forcing an unpublished package version. Fuzzing evidence now includes both the passing Echidna workflow and the passing TypeScript fast-check property suite.

| Finding or Scorecard signal | Why it cannot be fixed only by a commit | Required action |
|---|---|---|
| Branch protection score | Branch protection is controlled by GitHub repository settings rather than source files; the documented policy is the configuration to verify | Verify that main requires one approving review, successful CodeQL/Echidna/Scorecard/CI checks, linear history, conversation resolution, no force pushes, and administrator enforcement |
| Code-review score | Historical direct pushes cannot be converted into reviewed changesets; the repository now requires reviewed pull requests for future changes | Continue using pull requests and obtain one approval before merging |
| Maintained score | The repository's age/history is evaluated by Scorecard, including the detector's recent-commit and issue-activity inputs | Continue the documented maintenance cadence, keep publishing releases and updates, and reassess after the repository history matures |
| CII Best Practices score | Scorecard reads the official OpenSSF Best Practices service; a source-controlled link cannot create an assessment or badge | The repository owner must [log in with GitHub and register the project](https://www.bestpractices.dev/en/projects/new), then complete the external assessment |
| GitHub alert API visibility | The current integration returned HTTP 403 for code-scanning, Dependabot, and secret-scanning alert endpoints | Review alerts in the repository's Security tab or grant the integration the required read scopes |

## Validation baseline

The repository must pass `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, `pnpm validate:references`, `pnpm audit --audit-level=moderate`, strict TypeScript lint, Hardhat compilation, the contract test suite, coverage, and configuration parsing. CodeQL, Echidna, and Scorecard results are produced by GitHub Actions after workflow files are pushed; they cannot be fully reproduced by the local Hardhat test command alone. At the time of the latest branch-protection update, the only remote branch was `main`; all remediation branches were merged and deleted, so there is no additional branch to merge.
