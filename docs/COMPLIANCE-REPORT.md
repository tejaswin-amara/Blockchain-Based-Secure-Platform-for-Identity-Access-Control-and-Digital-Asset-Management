# Compliance Report

## Scope and conclusion

This report evaluates the repository against **Problem Statement 26125**, the attached **Comprehensive System Architecture Proposal** for Bharat Electronics Limited, and the attached **SIH 2026 – Mistakes, Technical Issues & Solutions** review. It also checks the seven documentation deliverable groups requested for the repository.

> **Conclusion:** The repository is compliant as a **traceable submission-ready final-project engineering foundation** for the stated scope. It is **not production-ready** because approved real identity verification, transaction signing/submission, persistent operations, live authenticated API deployment, independent verifier, IPFS/object-storage service, production key custody, organizational network governance, and independent security assurance are absent. The contract implementation is intentionally labeled a prototype and is not independently audited.

The applied fixes include manager-only controlled transfers, disabled standard ERC-721 approvals, explicit non-reverting access decisions, duplicate-safe identity and asset registration, active-identity enforcement, replacement-key recovery, structured events, a pause mechanism, ECDSA/secp256k1 MVP selection, ERC-721 selection, encrypted-IPFS wording, and separation of NFT ownership from access permission. Curated adoption and provenance boundaries for the 15 supplied repositories are recorded in [`docs/REFERENCED-REPOSITORIES.md`](REFERENCED-REPOSITORIES.md), [`docs/REFERENCE-INTEGRATION.md`](REFERENCE-INTEGRATION.md), and [`THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`](../THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md).

## Compliance status legend

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Compliant for MVP** | The requirement is implemented and tested for the local prototype or is fully documented within its declared scope |
| **Partially compliant** | The architecture or baseline exists, but implementation, organizational approval, or independent evidence remains |
| **Design complete** | The repository records a clear decision and limitation, but an external integration or verifier is still absent |
| **Not evidenced** | The repository does not contain the implementation or evidence needed to claim the capability |
| **Blocked for production** | A security, privacy, governance, or operational gate must be completed before production use |

## Proposal-to-repository alignment

| Proposal requirement | Repository position | Status | Required next evidence |
|---|---|---:|---|
| SSI/DID-based identity | ECDSA/secp256k1 wallet authentication, DID-hash lifecycle, and DID-hash uniqueness are implemented; this remains a blockchain-backed DID registry/reference, not complete SSI | **Partially compliant** | Approved DID method, DID-document/verification-method design, and identity assurance review |
| Identity Registry contract | `SecureAssetPlatform` implements registration, duplicate rejection, status changes, key replacement, events, and local deployment/test evidence | **Compliant for MVP** | Independent review, approved recovery ceremony, and deployment artifact |
| On-chain RBAC | `ADMIN`, `MANAGER`, `AUDITOR`, and `USER` roles use explicit default-admin administration, active-identity checks, role revocation, and negative tests; manager-controlled access-rule overrides are recorded per asset/action/requester | **Compliant for MVP** | Multisig/institutional custody, tenant scope, policy delegation, fuzz/invariant tests, and independent review |
| NFT asset ledger | ERC-721 unique assets, unique organizational asset IDs, fixed-size metadata hashes, explicit active/suspended/revoked/retired status, manager-only transfers, and duplicate tests | **Compliant for MVP** | Physical-asset registry, standard-selection approval, independent review, and deployment evidence |
| Encrypted off-chain asset data | A local AES-256-GCM envelope primitive now provides authenticated encryption, fresh nonces, associated-data binding, serialization, and tamper tests; no storage adapter or key custody exists | **Partially compliant** | Key-wrapping implementation, KMS/HSM decision, revocation, retention, malware/size/availability controls, and production storage tests |
| Hyperledger Fabric or private Polygon | ADR 0002 selects local Hardhat EVM for MVP and defers the production network | **Design complete** | Approved permissioned network, validator/operator governance, finality, privacy, and residency evidence |
| Immutable audit trail | Structured contract events, asset status changes, non-reverting access decisions, strict ABI decoding, raw/derived retention, checkpointing, uncertainty/replay, and reconciliation references are implemented | **Partially compliant** | Approved finality/RPC policy, persistent worker/backfill, independent verification, operational audit export, and monitoring |
| API/service boundary | A fail-closed FastAPI boundary validates configuration, request IDs, CORS, security headers, RPC chain/code readiness, bearer-auth presence, a protected sanitized audit route, and a protected typed intent route; configured database/contract settings lazily wire durable adapters | **Partially compliant** | Approved OIDC/JWKS or wallet verifier, route authorization, signer/receipt state workflow, distributed rate limits, tenant policy, and operations |
| Web/mobile client | A repository-native Vite/React Evidence Ledger console displays only sanitized audit data when configured, has no signer or browser-secret persistence, and reports unavailable states | **Partially compliant** | Wallet/identity adapter, live API/auth integration, accessibility review, end-to-end tests, mobile strategy, and independent verifier |
| Production-grade Solidity | Contract baseline is compiled and tested but is explicitly prototype-only | **Blocked for production** | Fuzz/invariant testing, independent audit, multisig/KMS custody, deployment controls, and incident runbook |
| BEL/SIH context | Problem Statement 26125 and BEL are recorded as context and intended evaluation audience | **Compliant as context** | Do not claim endorsement, ownership, or authorization without written approval |

## Applied SIH issue remediation

| Issue group | Corrected behavior | Evidence | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Transfer and approval bypass | `_update` checks active endpoints; `transferAsset`, `transferFrom`, and `safeTransferFrom` require an active manager; `approve` and `setApprovalForAll` revert | `contracts/SecureAssetPlatform.sol`, transfer tests | **Fixed for MVP** |
| Owner auto-transfer | Owners can request access but cannot transfer; transfers require the manager workflow | Contract, README, acceptance criteria | **Fixed for MVP** |
| Failed access logging | `requestAccess` commits an `AccessDecision` with `GRANTED` or `DENIED` and does not rely on reverted events; manager policy overrides emit `AccessRuleSet` | Contract, tests, architecture | **Fixed for MVP; policy service pending** |
| Identity lifecycle | Duplicate registration is rejected; deactivation/offboarding revokes operational roles; replacement keys suspend old identities | Contract, lifecycle tests | **Fixed for MVP** |
| SSI and signature claims | ECDSA/secp256k1 is selected for the EVM MVP; DID language is bounded to a registry/reference | ADR 0002, architecture, README | **Fixed in claims** |
| IPFS and encryption | AES-256-before-IPFS, CID/multihash wording, key wrapping, KMS/HSM extension, and post-decryption leakage limits are explicit; local AES-GCM envelope and tamper tests now exist without a storage adapter | README, architecture, security, threat model, `services/storage/` | **Fixed in design; local primitive added; managed service pending** |
| Duplicate physical assets | Unique organizational `assetId` mapping rejects duplicate asset registration, and explicit asset status prevents access/transfer of suspended, revoked, or retired assets | Contract, tests, traceability matrix | **Fixed for MVP** |
| Ownership versus physical/legal title | Documentation requires QR/NFC and organizational registration and rejects automatic legal-title claims | Architecture, README | **Design complete; verifier pending** |
| Role separation and auditor use | Operational roles are separate from default admin; auditors can submit explicit read/access decisions; a read-only Evidence Ledger console exposes only sanitized projection fields | Contract, tests, architecture, `apps/web/` | **Fixed for MVP; live auth/dashboard workflow pending** |
| Audit event quality | Generic `AccessRecorded` was removed; structured identity, key, asset, access-decision, role, transfer, pause, and standard ERC-721 events remain; strict ABI projection decodes the approved event surface | Contract, indexer tests, threat model | **Fixed for MVP; operational worker pending** |
| Scope and overclaims | MVP commits to local Hardhat EVM, Solidity, OpenZeppelin, ERC-721, and controlled fees; production/HSM/multisig/network claims are gated | ADR 0002, roadmap, compliance report | **Fixed in scope and claims** |
| Emergency response | OpenZeppelin `Pausable` controls are implemented and tested | Contract, test, threat model | **Fixed for MVP** |
| Ownership/access separation | `requestAccess` evaluates policy independently of token ownership and transfer authority | Contract, README, acceptance criteria | **Fixed for MVP; off-chain retrieval pending** |
| Delivery scope | Core demo is prioritized: wallet/DID, RBAC, encrypted storage boundary, ERC-721, controlled access, and structured audit; QR/NFC and multisig are staged later | Roadmap, acceptance criteria | **Fixed in scope** |

## Required production gates

The project must not be described as production-grade until all of the following have evidence: an approved identity and credential model; fuzz and invariant contract tests beyond the current negative-test baseline; independent smart-contract review; secure key custody and multi-party administrative controls; network and validator governance; IPFS or object-storage encryption and lifecycle controls; API and client authorization tests; indexer reconciliation and incident runbooks; backup and recovery tests; physical-asset verification; privacy and legal review; monitoring and alert ownership; and an approved release and rollback policy. The MVP threat model and acceptance criteria are documented, but they do not constitute independent assurance.

## Review outcome

The repository may be submitted as a **final-project engineering foundation with executable local evidence** for the Smart India Hackathon problem statement. It should not be submitted or represented as a deployed enterprise platform, completed security solution, legal ownership system, or BEL-endorsed implementation until the gates above are satisfied. The status of each gate should be updated through reviewed pull requests and linked evidence rather than by changing this conclusion alone. Requirement-level evidence is tracked in [`docs/PROBLEM-STATEMENT-TRACEABILITY.md`](PROBLEM-STATEMENT-TRACEABILITY.md), workflow/dependency scanning evidence is tracked in [`docs/SECURITY-SCANNING-STATUS.md`](SECURITY-SCANNING-STATUS.md), and the complete improvement backlog is tracked in [`docs/COMPREHENSIVE-IMPROVEMENT-AND-FIX-REGISTER.md`](COMPREHENSIVE-IMPROVEMENT-AND-FIX-REGISTER.md).
