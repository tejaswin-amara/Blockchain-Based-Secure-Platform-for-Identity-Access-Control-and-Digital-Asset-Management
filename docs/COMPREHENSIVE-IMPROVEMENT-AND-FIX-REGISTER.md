# Comprehensive Improvement and Fix Register

**Repository:** Blockchain-Based-Secure-Platform-for-Identity-Access-Control-and-Digital-Asset-Management
**Scope:** Smart India Hackathon 2026 Problem Statement 26125, Bharat Electronics Limited evaluation context
**Review basis:** Repository state on the consolidated `main` branch, current Scorecard SARIF, local validation results, architecture, threat model, traceability matrix, acceptance criteria, and security policies
**Status:** The repository is an executable Solidity/Hardhat MVP baseline with a comprehensive design suite. It is **not a production platform** until the gates in this register are completed.

> **Purpose.** This register is intentionally exhaustive. It includes work that is already complete but must remain monitored, work that is partially implemented, work that is absent, work that requires GitHub or OpenSSF administration, and work that can only improve with legitimate project history. No alert should be marked resolved merely because a workflow passed or because a narrative statement was added.

## 1. Current baseline and non-negotiable interpretation

The current repository contains the `SecureAssetPlatform` Solidity contract, Hardhat 3 tooling, OpenZeppelin Contracts, unit and negative tests, an Echidna harness, a TypeScript `fast-check` property test, CI, CodeQL, Scorecard, release automation, dependency automation, and the requested documentation/reference suite. The latest merged main commit is [`d9b40f4`](https://github.com/tejaswin-amara/Blockchain-Based-Secure-Platform-for-Identity-Access-Control-and-Digital-Asset-Management/commit/d9b40f431d376a49713de76b60fb59360fef08b1). The only remote branch is `main`; earlier remediation branches were merged and deleted.

The latest main-branch workflows passed for CI, CodeQL, Echidna, Scorecard, and release automation. The latest Scorecard SARIF still reports **SASTID**, **CodeReviewID**, **MaintainedID**, and **CIIBestPracticesID**. Scorecard’s own documentation explains that these checks measure different things: SAST coverage, legitimate human review history, repository age/activity, and an external OpenSSF Best Practices badge respectively.[1] CodeQL is a security analysis engine whose results become GitHub Code Scanning alerts.[2] The action and workflow passing therefore proves current execution, not that all historical commits were scanned or reviewed.

The implementation is deliberately bounded to a prototype. It currently does **not** contain the intended FastAPI API, event indexer, PostgreSQL read model, Redis/BullMQ jobs, Next.js client, encrypted storage service, IPFS pinning service, KMS/HSM integration, permissioned network deployment, physical-asset verifier, production monitoring, or independent contract audit. The `.env.example`, architecture, contributor guide, and acceptance criteria describe these future components, so configuration and documentation drift must be corrected as implementation progresses.

## 2. Priority and status definitions

| Priority | Meaning | Release rule |
|---|---|---|
| **P0 — security blocker** | A weakness could enable unauthorized control, data exposure, supply-chain compromise, irreversible loss, or misleading assurance. | Must be fixed or formally risk-accepted before any testnet or real data. |
| **P1 — testnet gate** | Required for a controlled testnet or integrated demonstration. | Must have implementation and evidence before testnet approval. |
| **P2 — pilot gate** | Required for bounded organizational use with controlled users/assets. | Must be complete before a pilot. |
| **P3 — production/continuous** | Required for production readiness or ongoing assurance. | Must be approved by accountable owners and continuously monitored. |

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Implemented / monitor** | The repository contains a baseline implementation, but regression, independent review, or operations evidence remains necessary. |
| **Partial** | Some implementation or design exists, but an integration, policy, or evidence gate is absent. |
| **Missing** | The capability is described or required but is not implemented in the current repository. |
| **External action** | The change requires a GitHub, OpenSSF, organizational, collaborator, or legal action that cannot be fabricated in source control. |
| **Time-based** | The signal depends on legitimate project age or future activity and cannot be immediately forced by code. |

## 3. Current Code Scanning and Scorecard alerts

| Alert | Finding | Severity shown | Current condition | Complete remediation path | Status |
|---:|---|---|---|---|---|
| **#19** | Maintained | High | The repository is younger than the Scorecard age threshold. Maintenance evidence now includes scheduled workflows, Dependabot, releases, changelog, security policy, contribution rules, and [`MAINTENANCE.md`](../MAINTENANCE.md). | Keep the project active, publish legitimate maintenance changes/releases, update issues and documentation, and reassess after the age threshold. Do not rewrite history or create artificial activity. | **Partial / time-based** |
| **#17** | Code-Review | High | `main` requires pull requests, one approval, last-push approval, conversation resolution, linear history, required checks, and administrator enforcement. Historical direct commits were not approved changesets. | Have a non-author collaborator approve future security-sensitive pull requests. For higher assurance, require two reviewers and code-owner review. Do not self-approve, fabricate a reviewer, or dismiss the finding without evidence. | **Future-process fix / historical limitation** |
| **#20** | SAST | Medium | CodeQL runs successfully on current pushes, pull requests, schedules, and manual dispatch. The Scorecard result reports only a fraction of historical commits with SAST coverage because the workflow was introduced later. | Keep CodeQL enabled, scan every new change, use the correct language configuration, review alerts, and preserve workflow history. Historical commits cannot be retroactively scanned by a workflow that did not exist at those revisions. | **Current control fixed / historical limitation** |
| **#16** | CII-Best-Practices | Low | The README links the official OpenSSF Best Practices program and honestly labels the assessment pending. Scorecard checks the external Best Practices service, not merely a README link.[3] | The repository owner must authenticate at [bestpractices.dev project registration](https://www.bestpractices.dev/en/projects/new), register the repository, complete the passing criteria, maintain the answers, and add the real project badge URL. | **External action required** |

### 3.1 GitHub controls to keep verified

1. Keep `main` protected with at least one required non-author review, require approval of the latest push, dismiss stale approvals, require conversation resolution, require the branch to be up to date, prevent force pushes and deletion, require status checks, and include administrators where practical.
2. Move from a single-person `CODEOWNERS` file to approved organization teams before production. Contracts, workflows, dependency policy, deployment configuration, identity, privacy, and storage must each have independent owners.
3. Require two reviewers and code-owner approval for contract authorization, identity, key-management, workflow-permission, deployment, and privacy changes before production.
4. Require pull requests for all changes, including administrator changes, and do not use administrator bypass for ordinary work.
5. Protect release tags and environments, require environment approvals for production deployment, and document who can deploy, pause, rotate keys, or publish releases.
6. Enable secret scanning, push protection, Dependabot alerts, dependency review, private vulnerability reporting, and security-advisory workflows where the repository plan supports them.
7. Review all required status-check names after workflow renames. A required check that never runs can deadlock merges; a required check that can be bypassed is not a security control.
8. Record branch-policy verification in a repository settings runbook because branch protection is not represented completely by source files.

## 4. Smart-contract remediation register

### 4.1 Identity and DID lifecycle

The contract stores an address-to-`bytes32` DID hash mapping, not a complete DID method or SSI implementation. W3C DID Core defines DIDs as identifiers resolvable to DID documents containing verification methods and services; a hash field alone is not a conforming DID method or resolver.[4]

| ID | Improvement or fix | Priority | Current state | Acceptance evidence |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| SC-ID-01 | Select and approve one DID method or an enterprise identity bridge. Define method syntax, creation, resolution, update, deactivation, controller semantics, and interoperability constraints. | P0 | Missing decision | ADR, method specification, resolver tests, approved owner and assurance level. |
| SC-ID-02 | Define the DID document and verification-method model, including key types, purposes, controllers, services, and rotation semantics. | P0 | Missing | Versioned schema, valid examples, conformance tests, and interoperability review. |
| SC-ID-03 | Implement DID resolution or a trusted resolver adapter; validate method-specific documents rather than accepting arbitrary hashes. | P1 | Missing | Resolver integration tests, negative malformed-document tests, timeout/failure behavior. |
| SC-ID-04 | Define identity assurance levels and the organizational verification authority. A wallet address must not automatically mean a verified employee or organization. | P0 | Partial in documentation | Approved assurance matrix, verification workflow, evidence retention, and periodic recertification. |
| SC-ID-05 | Enforce DID-hash uniqueness or document the collision/linkability policy. The current mapping prevents duplicate addresses but does not prove that two addresses do not claim the same DID hash. | P0 | Missing contract rule | Duplicate-DID tests, explicit reuse/reassignment policy, migration plan. |
| SC-ID-06 | Decide whether an identity may have multiple active keys and model controller/delegate relationships. | P1 | Missing | State model, authorization tests, rotation and revocation events. |
| SC-ID-07 | Add nonce, domain-separation, chain-ID, contract-address, expiry, and audience protection for all off-chain signed authentication and transaction-intent messages. | P0 | Missing because no API exists | EIP-4361-compatible login tests, replay tests, wrong-domain tests, expired-message tests.[5] |
| SC-ID-08 | Implement key rotation and revocation as a formal ceremony with old-key invalidation, replacement proof, approval quorum, and audit evidence. | P0 | Contract replacement baseline exists; ceremony missing | Recovery runbook, two-person approval test, audit record, failed-recovery tests. |
| SC-ID-09 | Define employee offboarding integration, including HR/identity approval, active sessions, credentials, roles, asset custody, and pending transactions. | P0 | Contract-only baseline | Offboarding workflow, integration test, asset-review record, completion audit. |
| SC-ID-10 | Define key-loss, compromise, death/incapacity, and disputed-identity recovery. Do not rely on a single administrator or an irreversible address mapping. | P0 | Missing governance | Recovery policy, multisig or institutional authority, tabletop drill, evidence retention. |
| SC-ID-11 | Define privacy treatment of DID hashes, including dictionary attacks, linkability, public-chain permanence, correlation across assets, and whether salted commitments are appropriate. | P0 | Partial | Privacy threat analysis, approved data-minimization decision, test vectors, legal/privacy review. |
| SC-ID-12 | Add explicit event/version fields for identity registration, status changes, key replacement, revocation reason, actor, policy version, and effective time without exposing personal data. | P1 | Partial | Published event schema, ABI compatibility tests, indexer fixtures, event completeness matrix. |

### 4.2 RBAC, authorization, and administrative control

| ID | Improvement or fix | Priority | Current state | Acceptance evidence |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| SC-RBAC-01 | Replace or protect the single default administrator with a multisignature or institutional approval authority. | P0 | Missing | Approved custody architecture, multisig deployment, signer inventory, quorum test, rotation drill. |
| SC-RBAC-02 | Define the complete role graph: who may grant/revoke each role, whether administrators can delegate, and whether role administration is scoped. | P0 | Partial | Role matrix, contract tests for every grant/revoke edge, governance approval. |
| SC-RBAC-03 | Decide global, tenant-scoped, asset-scoped, and time-bounded permissions. The current roles are global and do not encode scope or expiry. | P0 | Missing | Authorization model, storage schema, contract/API parity tests, expiry tests. |
| SC-RBAC-04 | Add least-privilege roles for deployment, pause, identity verification, asset registration, metadata approval, audit, and recovery rather than concentrating authority. | P1 | Missing | Role decomposition ADR, role graph review, least-privilege tests. |
| SC-RBAC-05 | Add two-person approval for high-impact operations: administrator changes, key recovery, physical-asset reassignment, bulk actions, pause release, and production deployment. | P0 | Missing | Approval state machine, quorum tests, timeout/cancellation behavior, audit export. |
| SC-RBAC-06 | Add reason, ticket/RFC reference, scope, expiry, and policy version to privileged operations where appropriate. | P1 | Partial | Event and API schema, validation tests, sanitized audit records. |
| SC-RBAC-07 | Define and test behavior when all administrators are inactive, when a role holder is compromised, and when a recovery target is disputed. | P0 | Missing | Emergency governance procedure, liveness/safety tests, approved break-glass process. |
| SC-RBAC-08 | Review the `grantRole` and `revokeRole` overrides against every OpenZeppelin `AccessControl` path and future extension. | P0 | Partial | Full inherited-surface test matrix, static analysis, independent contract review. |
| SC-RBAC-09 | Decide whether default-admin immutability is correct. If it is retained, define a safe institutional migration path; if not, implement controlled admin rotation without ordinary uncontrolled grants. | P0 | Partial | ADR, migration contract/test, recovery proof, deployment runbook. |
| SC-RBAC-10 | Ensure off-chain authorization never trusts client role labels or stale database projections. | P0 | API missing | API authorization tests against canonical chain state and stale/read-model failure cases. |

### 4.3 NFT and digital-asset lifecycle

ERC-721 defines basic functionality for tracking and transferring non-fungible tokens, but the project intentionally disables standard approval paths and adds a manager-only enterprise policy.[6] That constrained interface must be documented, tested, and accepted by every consumer.

| ID | Improvement or fix | Priority | Current state | Acceptance evidence |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| SC-ASSET-01 | Approve the token standard and compatibility boundary. Decide whether controlled enterprise assets should remain ERC-721-compatible or use a purpose-built non-transferable/permissioned interface. | P0 | MVP decision recorded | ADR, consumer compatibility tests, security/legal review. |
| SC-ASSET-02 | Add explicit asset lifecycle states: proposed, approved, minted, allocated, verified, suspended, revoked, retired, and recovered. | P1 | Design only | State machine in contract or authoritative service, transition tests, event schema. |
| SC-ASSET-03 | Define the canonical organizational asset registry and authority for `assetId`; reject stale, reused, ambiguous, or unauthorized physical identifiers. | P0 | `bytes32` uniqueness only | Registry integration, uniqueness tests, reconciliation report, owner approval. |
| SC-ASSET-04 | Implement physical-asset binding with QR/NFC or an approved alternative, including tag issuance, replacement, tamper handling, offline verification, and chain-of-custody records. | P1 | Missing | Verifier prototype, anti-counterfeit tests, custody workflow, acceptance demo. |
| SC-ASSET-05 | Define token metadata and URI policy. The current contract stores a metadata hash but does not expose an encrypted object reference or `tokenURI`. | P1 | Missing | Metadata schema, privacy review, URI/CID access policy, independent verification tool. |
| SC-ASSET-06 | Define metadata update, versioning, revocation, and correction behavior. Decide whether the hash is immutable, append-only, or governed by a controlled update. | P1 | Missing | Contract/service design, migration and event tests, legal/records approval. |
| SC-ASSET-07 | Define burn, retirement, suspension, seizure, and recovery semantics. An asset cannot be operationally invalidated only by changing an off-chain label. | P0 | Missing | State transitions, role/quorum tests, immutable audit evidence, recovery runbook. |
| SC-ASSET-08 | Test every ERC-721 ownership-change path, including 3-argument and 4-argument safe transfers, `transferFrom`, internal `_update`, mint callbacks, receiver reentrancy, and future extensions. | P0 | Partial | Complete path matrix, malicious receiver fixture, reentrancy review, fuzz results. |
| SC-ASSET-09 | Test approval-disabled behavior against wallets, indexers, explorers, and SDKs. A standard consumer may assume approvals work. | P1 | Partial | Compatibility report, explicit errors, integration tests, user-facing explanation. |
| SC-ASSET-10 | Define access policy per asset and action. Current `requestAccess` gives owners, managers, or auditors a broad decision and does not encode a configurable policy. | P0 | Missing | Policy schema, deny-by-default tests, delegated access tests, expiry/revocation tests. |
| SC-ASSET-11 | Decide whether `requestAccess` should reject nonexistent tokens or record a denial. Define zero-action handling, reason codes, policy version, and privacy-preserving audit fields. | P1 | Ambiguous | ADR, contract tests, event schema, API behavior specification. |
| SC-ASSET-12 | Add limits and validation for batch operations, asset IDs, metadata commitments, and gas-heavy operations. | P1 | Missing | Boundary tests, gas snapshots, DoS analysis, operational limits. |
| SC-ASSET-13 | Add a canonical asset verification CLI or web tool that works independently of the main UI. | P1 | Missing | Given network/address/ABI/token ID, tool reproduces owner, events, state, and metadata integrity. |
| SC-ASSET-14 | Define legal ownership, custody, possession, operational access, and token ownership as separate records. | P0 | Documented only | Approved legal/records model, custody workflow, user-facing warnings, audit export. |

### 4.4 Contract engineering and deployment safety

| ID | Improvement or fix | Priority | Current state | Acceptance evidence |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| SC-ENG-01 | Obtain an independent smart-contract security review covering authorization, ERC-721 overrides, identity lifecycle, storage, events, denial-of-service, and deployment assumptions. | P0 | Missing | Signed review report, tracked findings, retest evidence, risk acceptance. |
| SC-ENG-02 | Add Slither or an equivalent Solidity static-analysis gate and publish reviewed findings. | P0 | Missing | CI report, approved suppressions with rationale, zero unreviewed high findings. |
| SC-ENG-03 | Add compiler-version, optimizer, EVM-target, and dependency compatibility matrix tests. | P1 | One compiler/EVM target | Reproducible matrix, approved supported versions, release evidence. |
| SC-ENG-04 | Strengthen Echidna invariants beyond default-admin and approval checks: role safety, active identities, unique assets, ownership, pause behavior, transfer authority, and event/state consistency. | P0 | Minimal harness | Fuzz campaign configuration, corpus, run artifacts, failure triage, passing CI. |
| SC-ENG-05 | Add stateful fuzzing sequences for register/deactivate/replace/offboard/grant/revoke/mint/transfer/pause/recover operations. | P0 | Missing | Stateful harness, seed-independent pass, minimized counterexamples. |
| SC-ENG-06 | Add property tests for all error selectors and event arguments, including malformed addresses, zero hashes, duplicate IDs, inactive endpoints, unauthorized callers, and paused state. | P1 | Partial | Error/event coverage report and negative-test matrix. |
| SC-ENG-07 | Add invariant checks for total supply, token-owner uniqueness, asset-ID uniqueness, no privileged inactive identities, and no state change on revert. | P0 | Partial | Fuzz and unit evidence linked to invariants. |
| SC-ENG-08 | Add gas snapshots and define operational gas limits for mint, role, identity, transfer, pause, and recovery operations. | P1 | Missing | CI gas budget, regression threshold, approved exceptions. |
| SC-ENG-09 | Decide upgradeability. The current contract is not presented as upgradeable; preserve that boundary or design a separately reviewed proxy/migration architecture. | P0 | Decision implicit | ADR, storage-layout policy, upgrade tests or explicit immutability statement. |
| SC-ENG-10 | Make deployment refuse unsafe networks, missing chain IDs, production-like placeholder keys, or an unapproved root administrator. | P0 | Local-only script | Dry-run failure tests, chain allowlist, operator confirmation, deployment policy. |
| SC-ENG-11 | Produce signed deployment manifests containing commit, compiler, optimizer, EVM target, chain ID, RPC identity, contract address, ABI hash, source hash, deployer/multisig, and timestamp. | P1 | Missing | Versioned manifest, signature/attestation, verified explorer/source record. |
| SC-ENG-12 | Add deployment verification and post-deployment smoke tests for roles, identity, pause, mint, transfer, access decision, events, and ownership. | P1 | Missing | Automated smoke job against a disposable testnet or local network. |
| SC-ENG-13 | Define emergency pause, unpause, migration, and incident communication procedures that do not assume immutable state can be deleted. | P0 | Pause exists; runbook missing | Incident drill, approval record, operator runbook, status template. |

## 5. Identity, API, indexer, and data-platform work

The architecture describes a canonical ledger plus recoverable projections. A database or API must never become the source of ownership truth, and a transaction must not be shown as successful before the required event and confirmation policy are verified.

### 5.1 API and authentication

| ID | Improvement or fix | Priority | Current state | Acceptance evidence |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| API-01 | Implement the FastAPI service or remove aspirational API commands until implementation exists. | P1 | Missing | Running service, versioned OpenAPI document, health/readiness endpoints. |
| API-02 | Implement wallet authentication using a nonce and domain-bound signed message such as EIP-4361; verify address, domain, URI, chain ID, nonce, issued-at, expiration, and session binding.[5] | P0 | Missing | Login/replay/cross-domain/expiry tests, session invalidation. |
| API-03 | Integrate approved enterprise identity/OIDC/PKI if wallet control is not the organization’s assurance mechanism. | P0 | Missing | Identity-provider design, claims mapping, assurance tests, offboarding integration. |
| API-04 | Enforce server-side authorization for every route using current contract state, application policy, tenant scope, and identity status. | P0 | Missing | Route matrix, deny-by-default tests, stale-projection tests. |
| API-05 | Add input validation, canonicalization, strict schemas, length limits, safe error responses, pagination, request IDs, and consistent error codes. | P1 | Missing | API contract tests, fuzzed request tests, generated OpenAPI. |
| API-06 | Add idempotency keys for mint, transfer, allocation, access-release, recovery, and upload operations. | P0 | Missing | Duplicate-request tests, retry behavior, idempotency storage policy. |
| API-07 | Track transaction state as requested, signed, submitted, pending, confirmed, failed, reverted, replaced, or unknown. | P0 | Missing | Transaction state machine, timeout/replacement tests, UI-visible status. |
| API-08 | Implement rate limiting, abuse controls, account lockout/step-up authentication, request quotas, and denial monitoring. | P1 | Missing | Load/abuse tests, rate-limit metrics, operator alerts. |
| API-09 | Harden CORS, cookies, CSRF protection where cookies are used, security headers, TLS, proxy trust, origin checks, and secret rotation. | P0 | Missing | Security configuration tests and deployment checklist. |
| API-10 | Publish privacy-safe audit APIs with actor pseudonyms, pagination, authorization, export controls, and redaction rules. | P1 | Missing | Data-access tests, export samples, privacy review. |
| API-11 | Decide whether the backend uses Python-native SQLAlchemy/Alembic or a TypeScript/Prisma service; remove unused alternatives from the target architecture. | P1 | Open decision | ADR, dependency policy, migration ownership. |

### 5.2 Indexer and reconciliation

| ID | Improvement or fix | Priority | Current state | Acceptance evidence |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| IDX-01 | Implement the event consumer for identity, role, asset, access, transfer, pause, and inherited standard events. | P1 | Missing | Running indexer and event fixtures. |
| IDX-02 | Use idempotent keys such as chain ID, contract address, transaction hash, log index, and event version. | P0 | Missing | Duplicate-delivery tests and unique database constraints. |
| IDX-03 | Implement confirmation/finality policy per network and do not expose unconfirmed ownership as final. | P0 | Missing | Confirmation tests, stale/pending state behavior, policy configuration. |
| IDX-04 | Handle RPC outages, provider failover, rate limits, timeouts, retries, exponential backoff, and bounded queues. | P1 | Missing | Fault-injection tests and retry metrics. |
| IDX-05 | Detect block gaps, missed logs, duplicate logs, cursor corruption, and incomplete backfills. | P0 | Missing | Gap detector, replay command, alerts, recovery report. |
| IDX-06 | Handle chain reorganizations by replaying affected ranges and marking uncertain records. | P0 | Missing | Reorg simulation tests and reconciliation evidence. |
| IDX-07 | Periodically reconcile projected ownership, roles, identity status, and asset mappings against canonical contract reads. | P0 | Missing | Drift test, reconciliation report, repair approval. |
| IDX-08 | Design database migrations, indexes, retention, tenant isolation, encryption, backup, restore, and least-privilege database accounts. | P0 | Missing | Migration tests, restore drill, schema review, access review. |
| IDX-09 | Define event schema versioning and backward-compatible handling for contract upgrades or new event fields. | P1 | Missing | Versioned schema, migration fixtures, compatibility tests. |
| IDX-10 | Provide operator commands for start block, backfill range, replay, pause, resume, dead-letter retry, and consistency verification. | P1 | Missing | Runbook and tested commands. |

### 5.3 Queue and workflow safety

| ID | Improvement or fix | Priority | Current state | Acceptance evidence |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| Q-01 | Implement durable jobs only for non-canonical work; never let a queue decide authorization. | P1 | Missing | Job ownership matrix and authorization tests. |
| Q-02 | Make every job idempotent, bounded, observable, and cancelable. | P1 | Missing | Retry/dead-letter/duplicate tests. |
| Q-03 | Add poison-message handling, operator replay approval, queue backpressure, and retention policy. | P1 | Missing | Fault-injection report and dashboard. |
| Q-04 | Separate user-visible transaction workflows from eventual indexing and notification jobs. | P0 | Missing | State diagram, API contract, failure tests. |

## 6. Encryption, IPFS, storage, privacy, and records

The design correctly states that IPFS/CIDs do not provide confidentiality and that encrypted payloads, not plaintext, must be stored externally. Encryption must use authenticated encryption with a secure key lifecycle; NIST key-management guidance covers generation, protection, use, rotation, recovery, and destruction.[7] AES-GCM’s nonce/tag handling must follow the approved cryptographic profile.[8]

| ID | Improvement or fix | Priority | Current state | Acceptance evidence |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| DATA-01 | Implement an approved payload-classification service that rejects raw identity documents, biometrics, secrets, or regulated data unless explicitly approved. | P0 | Design only | Classification rules, rejection tests, privacy owner approval. |
| DATA-02 | Implement envelope encryption with fresh cryptographically random 256-bit DEKs, AES-256-GCM or approved equivalent, unique nonces, authentication tags, algorithm/version metadata, and associated-data binding. | P0 | Missing | Known-answer tests, tamper tests, nonce tests, crypto review. |
| DATA-03 | Protect DEKs with KMS/HSM envelope wrapping; never place DEKs, wrapping keys, private keys, or credentials in source, logs, browser code, or events. | P0 | Missing | KMS design, IAM policy, audit logs, key-rotation test, secret scan. |
| DATA-04 | Define key hierarchy, tenant separation, purpose binding, versioning, rotation, re-wrapping, revocation, recovery, destruction, and dual control. | P0 | Missing | Key-management policy, rotation/recovery drill, evidence export. |
| DATA-05 | Implement controlled key release after identity, role, asset, policy, confirmation, and approval checks. A successful on-chain access decision must not automatically release a key. | P0 | Missing | End-to-end authorization tests, denial tests, expiry/revocation tests. |
| DATA-06 | Choose IPFS versus object storage, define pinning providers, replication, availability, gateway policy, private retrieval, CID leakage controls, and content removal limitations. | P1 | Missing | Storage ADR, availability test, recovery drill, threat model update. |
| DATA-07 | Bind the on-chain commitment to canonical encrypted bytes and metadata, preventing substitution, version confusion, or algorithm downgrade. | P0 | Partial | Commitment format, tamper/substitution tests, verifier implementation. |
| DATA-08 | Add secure upload/download paths with size/type limits, malware scanning, content disarm where needed, signed URLs, expiration, authorization, audit, and no plaintext caching. | P0 | Missing | Upload abuse tests, cache/header review, malware-test fixtures, audit records. |
| DATA-09 | Define retention, deletion, legal hold, backup retention, revocation, subject-rights handling, and immutable-ledger limitations. | P0 | Design only | Privacy/legal review, policy matrix, deletion/retention tests. |
| DATA-10 | Complete a privacy impact assessment and data-flow inventory for identity, asset, event, logs, analytics, backups, and third-party services. | P0 | Missing | Approved PIA/DPIA, data inventory, processor/subprocessor list. |
| DATA-11 | Minimize personal data in events, token metadata, CIDs, logs, error messages, screenshots, fixtures, and telemetry. | P0 | Policy only | Automated secret/PII checks, red-team review, fixture audit. |
| DATA-12 | Add backup encryption, key separation, restore verification, geographic/residency policy, RPO/RTO, and immutable backup protection. | P1 | Missing | Restore drill, RPO/RTO report, backup access review. |
| DATA-13 | Add DLP, watermarking, controlled viewers, endpoint restrictions, or other organizational controls for post-decryption copying risk. | P2 | Missing | Approved residual-risk decision and control test. |

## 7. Frontend, wallet, accessibility, and user safety

The intended client is not implemented. Any future web/mobile client must treat the wallet as a signing device, not as proof of organizational identity, and must make transaction scope and authorization state understandable. WCAG 2.2 provides the accessibility baseline for perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust interfaces.[9]

| ID | Improvement or fix | Priority | Current state | Acceptance evidence |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| UI-01 | Implement the Next.js/React web console or remove unsupported start commands from user documentation until it exists. | P1 | Missing | Running client, production build, deployment manifest. |
| UI-02 | Implement mobile/wallet adapter strategy, supported wallets, hardware-wallet behavior, chain switching, account changes, and disconnect handling. | P1 | Missing | Wallet compatibility matrix and end-to-end tests. |
| UI-03 | Display network, chain ID, contract address, method, parameters, asset, recipient, fees, and expected impact before every privileged signature. | P0 | Missing | Transaction-preview tests and phishing review. |
| UI-04 | Never display client-provided role labels or cached ownership as authoritative; refresh critical state from API/canonical chain. | P0 | Missing | Stale-state and permission-rendering tests. |
| UI-05 | Implement clear pending, confirmed, failed, reverted, replaced, stale, and reconciliation-warning states. | P0 | Missing | E2E transaction-state tests. |
| UI-06 | Implement identity, roles, assets, access decisions, audit, recovery, and offboarding screens with separate privileges and redaction. | P1 | Missing | Role-based E2E matrix and privacy review. |
| UI-07 | Meet WCAG 2.2 baseline: keyboard navigation, focus, labels, headings, contrast, errors, status announcements, timing, responsive layout, and reduced-motion behavior. | P1 | Missing | axe or equivalent report plus manual keyboard/screen-reader review. |
| UI-08 | Add Cypress or Playwright tests for login, role assignment, mint, allocation, access denial/grant, transfer, pause, recovery, failed transaction, and stale indexer states. | P1 | Missing | CI E2E artifacts and failure triage. |
| UI-09 | Prevent sensitive payloads, keys, tokens, and decrypted content from browser logs, analytics, crash reports, local storage, and URLs. | P0 | Missing | Browser instrumentation review and automated checks. |
| UI-10 | Add user education for token ownership versus legal title, access permission versus decryption, irreversible signatures, and recovery limits. | P1 | Missing | Content review and usability test. |

## 8. Infrastructure, network, and deployment governance

The current deployment script is intentionally for a disposable local/test network. Production requires an approved network, validator/operator governance, finality and reorganization policy, custody, monitoring, privacy, and data-residency evidence.

| ID | Improvement or fix | Priority | Current state | Acceptance evidence |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| OPS-01 | Select the production network: permissioned EVM, private Polygon, Fabric-compatible architecture, or another approved network. | P0 | Open ADR | Decision record, threat model, cost/performance, privacy, finality, residency, and operator approval. |
| OPS-02 | Define validator/operator membership, onboarding/offboarding, key custody, quorum, upgrades, incident response, and governance. | P0 | Missing | Network governance policy and tabletop exercise. |

## 9. Observability, audit, and incident response

| ID | Improvement or fix | Priority | Current state | Acceptance evidence |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| OBS-01 | Define operation/correlation IDs across UI, API, queue, transaction, event, indexer, storage, and audit export. | P1 | Design only | Trace example and propagation tests. |
| OBS-02 | Instrument transaction success/revert/replacement rates, confirmation latency, indexing lag, gaps, reorgs, drift, queue retries, RPC errors, auth failures, and denied access. | P1 | Missing | Metrics catalog, dashboards, alerts, synthetic tests. |

## 10. CI/CD, supply chain, and repository hygiene

The repository has strong baseline hardening: workflow actions are pinned to commit SHAs, permissions are constrained, CodeQL and Echidna run, and the Hardhat 2/`elliptic` dependency path was removed. The remaining work is to keep the controls accurate as the intended full stack is added. SLSA provides a useful vocabulary for build provenance and tracing artifacts back to source and build inputs.[10]

| ID | Improvement or fix | Priority | Current state | Acceptance evidence |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| SCM-01 | Keep every GitHub Action pinned to a reviewed immutable SHA and document the action version/comment. | P0 | Implemented / monitor | Automated SHA-pinning test and Dependabot review. |
| SCM-02 | Pin Docker base images and service images by digest when Docker or production images are introduced. | P0 | Missing for future stack | Digest policy and image scan report. |
| SCM-03 | Add SBOM generation for dependencies, containers, contracts, and release artifacts. | P1 | Missing | SPDX/CycloneDX artifacts attached to releases. |
| SCM-04 | Add artifact attestations/provenance and verify them before release or deployment. | P1 | Missing | Signed provenance, verification job, release evidence. |
| SCM-05 | Add dependency-review gating for new vulnerabilities, licenses, transitive changes, and unexpected package additions. | P1 | Partial | PR gate, approved allowlist, failure test. |
| SCM-06 | Continue `pnpm audit --audit-level=moderate`, frozen installs, lockfile review, and exact-version review for security-sensitive tooling. | P0 | Implemented / monitor | Passing CI, scheduled review, documented exceptions. |
| SCM-07 | Review all pnpm overrides periodically; remove overrides that are no longer necessary and record why each remains. | P1 | Partial | Override inventory and quarterly review. |
| SCM-08 | Add license and provenance scanning for all dependencies and curated references; verify that no reference repository is accidentally vendored. | P1 | Partial | License report, third-party notice review, CI check. |
| SCM-09 | Enable secret scanning and push protection; scan Git history and artifacts, not only the working tree. | P0 | Must verify in GitHub | Clean report and prevention test. |
| SCM-10 | Add CodeQL coverage for Python, YAML/actions, and future languages when those components are implemented; do not claim coverage for absent code. | P0 | JavaScript/TypeScript current | Language matrix, successful runs, alert triage. |
| SCM-11 | Add Solidity static analysis and dependency scanning separate from CodeQL because CodeQL does not replace contract-specific analysis. | P0 | Missing | CI reports and reviewed suppressions. |
| SCM-12 | Add fuzzing campaign retention, corpus artifacts, deterministic seeds for triage, and scheduled longer runs. | P1 | Minimal Echidna/fast-check baseline | CI artifacts, scheduled run, failure replay. |
| SCM-13 | Make CI fail rather than silently pass when an expected component is absent. The current conditional Python steps can conceal a missing API test suite. | P1 | Drift risk | Explicit component matrix and failure policy. |
| SCM-14 | Remove or correct unused CI services and environment variables until PostgreSQL, Redis, and the API/indexer exist. | P1 | Current CI starts services not consumed by the contract-only project | CI duration/resource review and accurate matrix. |
| SCM-15 | Add change-impact routing so contract/workflow/security/data changes require security and domain reviewers. | P0 | Single-owner CODEOWNERS | Team-based CODEOWNERS and PR enforcement. |
| SCM-16 | Protect release tags, use environment approvals, and restrict release-token permissions to the minimum required operations. | P0 | Permissions partially hardened | Settings verification and release dry run. |
| SCM-17 | Add reproducible-build verification for contract artifacts, frontend bundles, containers, and release archives. | P1 | Missing | Independent rebuild hash comparison. |
| SCM-18 | Review semantic-release behavior so tags, changelog changes, npm settings, and GitHub releases cannot bypass the required pull-request process. | P1 | Automated release exists | Release threat model and dry-run evidence. |

## 11. Configuration and documentation consistency

| ID | Improvement or fix | Priority | Current state | Acceptance evidence |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| DOC-01 | Either implement `services/api`, `services/indexer`, `apps/web`, `packages/*`, and Docker Compose or label every related command and configuration value as planned. | P1 | Documentation describes absent components | Clean-checkout command audit. |
| DOC-02 | Correct `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` commands that invoke missing `services/api/requirements.txt` and `services/api/tests`. | P1 | Documentation drift | Commands work or are explicitly marked future-stage. |

| DOC-11 | Replace placeholder security/support contacts with approved monitored channels before public launch. | P0 | Placeholder | Contact test and ownership record. |
| DOC-12 | Keep `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`, reference catalog, integration matrix, and license boundaries current; do not imply that reference repositories are integrated runtime code unless they are actually adopted. | P1 | Implemented / monitor | Reference validator and quarterly review. |
| DOC-13 | Add an explicit data dictionary for every on-chain field, event field, off-chain record, identifier, hash, CID, and audit field. | P1 | Missing | Data dictionary reviewed by security/privacy and implementation owners. |
| DOC-14 | Add versioned migration notes whenever a contract event, role, metadata commitment, environment variable, API route, or storage schema changes. | P1 | Policy exists; implementation absent | Migration template and sample migration. |

## 12. Governance, ownership, and human assurance

| ID | Improvement or fix | Priority | Current state | Acceptance evidence |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| GOV-01 | Recruit at least one independent contract/security reviewer who is not the change author and has sufficient repository permissions. | P0 | Missing | Approved PRs with reviewer identity and review scope. |
| GOV-02 | Add approved organization teams to CODEOWNERS for contracts, security workflows, identity, privacy, infrastructure, and releases. | P0 | Single owner | Team ownership and successful CODEOWNERS enforcement. |

| GOV-07 | Define release authority, deployment authority, key-custody authority, incident authority, and emergency authority separately. | P0 | Roles documented but concentrated | RACI, access review, break-glass log. |
| GOV-08 | Complete OpenSSF Best Practices registration and maintain answers as code, processes, and team structure change. | P1 | External action | Registered project, passing assessment, real badge URL. |
| GOV-09 | Build legitimate review history through normal reviewed PRs. Do not generate empty commits, self-approvals, or artificial collaborators to manipulate Scorecard. | P0 | Historical signal remains | Subsequent reviewed PRs and review-quality audit. |
| GOV-10 | Treat Scorecard’s Maintained age signal as time-based; continue real maintenance rather than rewriting history. | P2 | Time-based | Ongoing releases/issues and later Scorecard reassessment. |

## 13. Testing and quality-assurance matrix

|---|---|---:|---|
| COM-01 | Obtain written confirmation of the intended evaluation relationship and avoid claiming BEL ownership, endorsement, authorization, or deployment. | P0 | Approved communication or explicit disclaimer. |
| COM-02 | Identify applicable privacy, cybersecurity, records, procurement, and data-residency obligations for the target organization and deployment. | P0 | Legal/privacy applicability assessment. |

## 15. Reference-repository and licensing controls

The 15 supplied repositories remain curated references, not automatically integrated runtime components. Keep the distinction explicit and preserve the current catalog, adoption matrix, and third-party notices.

| ID | Improvement or fix | Priority | Acceptance evidence |
|---|---|---:|---|
| REF-01 | Revalidate all 15 canonical URLs and repository names periodically. | P2 | Passing `validate:references` and review record. |

| REF-06 | Separate design inspiration from tested product behavior in README, architecture, compliance, and demos. | P1 | Claims review and traceability update. |

## 16. Correctness and repository hygiene checks to perform every change

1. Run `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` and review the lockfile diff.
2. Run `pnpm audit --audit-level=moderate`; investigate every new advisory and document any accepted exception.
3. Run `pnpm validate:references`.
4. Run `pnpm lint`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm run test:coverage`, and `pnpm build`.
5. Run contract-specific static analysis and fuzzing when Solidity changes.
6. Run API/indexer/frontend/storage tests when those components are added; do not let conditional CI logic hide an absent suite.
7. Validate every workflow YAML, JSON configuration file, Dockerfile, environment schema, and deployment manifest.
8. Verify every action, container, package, compiler, and external tool is pinned or governed by a documented update policy.
9. Run secret scanning against the working tree, staged diff, Git history, artifacts, logs, and test fixtures.
10. Run `git diff --check`, inspect the staged patch, and verify no generated build output or credentials are accidentally tracked.
11. Confirm documentation, ADRs, threat model, acceptance criteria, traceability, changelog, third-party notices, and release notes match the code.
12. Ensure the PR states deployment context: prototype-only, testnet-ready, pilot, or production gate.

## 17. Release gates

### Gate A — Current local MVP

The contract must compile reproducibly, all unit/negative/property tests must pass, the local deployment must be disposable, and the README/compliance documents must state that no production readiness or audit is claimed.

### Gate B — Controlled testnet

Before any testnet deployment, complete the DID/identity decision, contract independent review, stronger invariants, deployment manifest, multisig or approved signer custody, event schema, verifier, basic indexer, transaction-status handling, monitoring, pause runbook, and sanitized demonstration.

### Gate C — Organizational pilot

Before a pilot, complete API authentication/authorization, indexer reorg/reconciliation, encrypted storage/key wrapping, backup/restore, offboarding/recovery, physical-asset verification, client accessibility, incident response, support ownership, privacy/legal review, bounded tenancy, and operator training.

### Gate D — Production

Before production, complete independent contract and application penetration testing, KMS/HSM and multi-party custody, network/validator governance, HA/failover, RTO/RPO drills, SBOM/provenance, release/rollback policy, real security contacts, privacy/records/legal approval, formal risk acceptance, independent verification, and a signed production go/no-go decision.

> **No-go conditions:** Do not use real identity data, live organizational assets, production private keys, or an unapproved public/permissioned network while any P0 gate is open. Do not describe the repository as production-grade, audited, legally dispositive, or BEL-endorsed without evidence.

## 18. Recommended execution order

| Sequence | Work package | Primary owners | Exit condition |
|---:|---|---|---|
| 1 | External governance: OpenSSF registration, independent reviewer recruitment, CODEOWNERS teams, branch-policy verification, real security contact | Maintainer, security lead, organization owner | External actions complete or explicitly tracked with accountable owners. |
| 2 | Contract assurance: DID method, role graph, admin custody, asset lifecycle, event schema, independent review, Slither, stateful fuzzing | Contract reviewer, security lead | Contract review report closed and test evidence published. |
| 3 | Configuration truth: environment schema, Dependabot/devcontainer/PR-template corrections, CI component matrix, release controls | Maintainer, DevOps | Clean checkout instructions work without hidden failures. |
| 4 | API/indexer foundation: authentication, authorization, transaction state, event ingestion, confirmations, reorgs, reconciliation | Backend/indexer lead | End-to-end canonical-state workflow passes failure tests. |
| 5 | Encryption/storage: envelope encryption, KMS/HSM, storage availability, key release/revocation, retention | Security lead, platform lead, privacy owner | Key lifecycle and restore/revocation drills pass. |
| 6 | Web/mobile client: wallet safety, transaction preview, permission views, accessibility, E2E | Frontend/mobile lead, accessibility reviewer | Critical flows pass E2E and manual accessibility review. |
| 7 | Testnet operations: approved network, deployment manifest, verified artifacts, monitoring, pause, incident, rollback | Release manager, network operator | Signed testnet go/no-go package. |
| 8 | Pilot and production assurance: privacy/legal, physical asset verifier, pen test, audit, DR, training, support, risk acceptance | Organization owner and all domain leads | Signed pilot/production decision with linked evidence. |

## 19. Definition of done for this register

An item is complete only when its implementation exists, tests cover both success and rejection/failure paths, documentation and configuration are synchronized, operational ownership is assigned, and evidence is linked from a reviewed pull request, release artifact, runbook, audit report, or approved governance record. A passing CI workflow alone is insufficient for identity assurance, legal title, privacy, cryptographic custody, independent contract security, or production readiness.
