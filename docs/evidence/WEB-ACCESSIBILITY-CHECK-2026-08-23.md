# Evidence Ledger Accessibility Check — 2026-08-23

## Scope

This check covers the repository-native, no-API-configured Evidence Ledger console. It evaluates the deliberate unavailable state and does not assert accessibility of future approved identity, transaction, verifier, multilingual, or live API workflows.

## Observed evidence

| Check | Method | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Semantic landmarks and descriptive heading | System-Chromium browser E2E inspection | Pass: skip link, named navigation, main region, heading hierarchy, table semantics, status filter label, and visible maturity boundaries rendered. |
| Keyboard entry and navigation | System-Chromium E2E | Pass: first `Tab` focuses the skip link; persistent rail control changes the active operational record. |
| Unavailable/error communication | System-Chromium E2E | Pass: with no public API base URL, the audit panel shows an explicit unavailable state and no illustrative chain records. |
| Browser persistence boundary | System-Chromium E2E | Pass: test observed empty `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`; no token input or secret persistence exists. |
| Automated WCAG rules | `@axe-core/playwright` on `#main-content` in system Chromium | Pass: no automated axe violations. The prior paper-panel contrast finding was corrected and rerun. |
| Responsive reflow | System-Chromium E2E at `375×812` and `1280×720` | Pass: the constrained Evidence Ledger heading remains visible and document `scrollWidth` does not exceed `clientWidth` at either viewport. |
| Responsive/visual smoke | Browser preview at local origin | Pass: ledger rail, readable typography, filter, control gates, and explicit unconfigured state were visually inspected. |

## Pending or out-of-scope work

| Area | Status |
|---|---|
| Screen-reader walkthrough with a named assistive technology and tester | Pending. |
| Formal color/zoom/reflow manual review across supported browsers | Pending. |
| Localization and translated-content accessibility | Pending; i18n is not yet implemented. |
| Live approved identity/API, transaction, and verifier paths | Blocked by external approval and deployment inputs. |

This evidence supports the local static console only. It is not an accessibility certification or a substitute for an inclusive design review before pilot or production use.
