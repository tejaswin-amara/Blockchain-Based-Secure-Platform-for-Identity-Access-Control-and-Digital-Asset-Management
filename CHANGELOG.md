# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog][1], and the project follows [Semantic Versioning][2] where versioning is meaningful for the release artifact. Smart-contract deployments may also require a separate deployment and migration identifier.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Initial repository documentation suite for decentralized identity references, role-based access control, NFT-backed digital-asset ownership, smart-contract governance, and immutable event auditing.
- Initial architecture, governance, security, contribution, support, and roadmap documents.
- Initial CI, supply-chain, environment, and AI-agent documentation plans are maintained alongside the project as implementation lands.
- Executable `SecureAssetPlatform` MVP with ECDSA/secp256k1-compatible EVM identity references, RBAC, unique asset IDs, ERC-721 ownership, manager-controlled transfers, explicit access decisions, replacement-key recovery, and pause controls.
- Problem Statement 26125 traceability matrix, threat model, acceptance criteria, and MVP asset/network ADR.

### Changed

- None.

### Deprecated

- None.

### Removed

- None.

### Fixed

- Replaced the generic audit event and failed-revert logging assumption with structured identity, key, asset, access-decision, role, transfer, and emergency events.
- Corrected README, architecture, roadmap, security, and compliance claims for encrypted IPFS, CID semantics, ownership/access separation, controlled transaction costs, ECDSA selection, and prototype scope.
- Pinned GitHub Actions, migrated the development toolchain from Hardhat 2 to Hardhat 3, locked semantic-release dependencies, added CodeQL and Echidna workflows, and added a moderate-or-higher dependency audit gate.

### Security

- The project remains prototype/MVP stage and has not been represented as independently audited or production-ready.
- The dependency audit is clean after removing the Hardhat 2 ethers v5 dependency path; `pnpm audit --audit-level=moderate` reports no known vulnerabilities. The remediation is tracked in `docs/SECURITY-SCANNING-STATUS.md`.
- No production contract addresses, credentials, or personal identity data are included in this documentation baseline.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-21

### Added

- Initial documentation and architecture baseline.
- MIT licensing and citation metadata.

### Security

- Documented private vulnerability reporting, supported versions, and safe handling of keys and identity data.
